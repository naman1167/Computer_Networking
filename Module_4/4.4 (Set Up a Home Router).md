# 🛠️ **First Time Setup**  

---

To connect to the router using a **wired connection**:  

1. 🔌 Plug an **Ethernet patch cable** into the **network port** on the computer.  
2. 🔗 Plug the other end into a **LAN port** on the router.  
3. 🚫 **Do NOT plug** the cable into the port labeled **“Internet”**—this port connects to the **DSL or cable modem**.  

💡 Some home routers come with a **built-in modem** for internet connections. Verify the connection type:  

- 📡 **Cable modem connection** → Has a **coaxial terminal** for a **BNC-type connector**.  
- ☎️ **DSL connection** → Uses an **RJ-11 connector** for a **telephone-type cable**.  

After ensuring the **computer is connected** to the router and the **link lights** indicate a **working connection**:  

✔️ The computer needs an **IP address**.  
✔️ Most routers **automatically assign** an IP address via a **DHCP server**.  
✔️ If the computer **does not** receive an IP, check the **router documentation** and manually configure:  
   - 🔢 **Unique IP address**  
   - 🛜 **Subnet mask**  
   - 🚪 **Default gateway**  
   - 🌍 **DNS information**

# 🤔 **What Should My Network Be Called?**  

📡 If **SSID broadcasting** is enabled, the **SSID name** will be visible to all **wireless clients** within range.  

⚠️ **Avoid revealing too much information!**  
❌ **Do NOT** use the **device model or brand name** in the SSID.  
📖 Default settings and **security weaknesses** are easy to find online.  

📡 Wireless devices **operate within specific frequency ranges**:  

- If a device only supports **802.11b/g**, it **will NOT connect** to a router set to **802.11n** or **802.11ac only**.  
- 🏎️ If all devices support the same standard, the network runs at **optimal speed**.  
- 🔄 If older devices **do not support 802.11n or 802.11ac**, **enable Legacy Mode** to allow compatibility.  

🔄 **Legacy Mode** may include:  
- 📶 **802.11a**  
- 📡 **802.11b**  
- 🚀 **802.11g**  
- ⚡ **802.11n**  
- 🌐 **802.11ac**  

This allows **older devices** to connect easily! 🔗
