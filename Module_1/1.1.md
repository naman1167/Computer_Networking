# **Welcome To the World of Network**  

---

We expect our devices, cell phones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers to always be connected to the global internet. We use this network to interact with our friends, shop, share pictures and experiences, and learn. The internet has become such a part of everyday life that we almost take it for granted.  

Normally, when people use the term internet, they are not referring to the physical connections in the real world. Rather, they tend to think of it as a formless collection of connections. It is the “place” people go to find or share information.

## **Who Owns The Internet**  

---

The internet is not owned by any individual or group. The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks (**internetwork or internet for short**), cooperating with each other to exchange information using common standards.  

Through telephone wires, fiber-optic cables, wireless transmissions, and satellite links, internet users can exchange information in a variety of forms.

## **Local Networks**  

---

Local networks come in all sizes. They can range from simple networks consisting of two computers to networks connecting hundreds of thousands of devices.  

**Networks installed in small offices, or homes and home offices, are referred to as Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) networks.** SOHO networks let you share resources such as printers, documents, pictures, and music between a few local users.  

In business, large networks can be used to advertise and sell products, order supplies, and communicate with customers. Communication over a network is usually more efficient and less expensive than traditional forms of communication, such as regular mail or long-distance phone calls.  

Networks allow for rapid communication such as email and instant messaging and provide consolidation and access to information stored on network servers.  

Business and SOHO networks usually provide a shared connection to the internet.  

> **The internet is considered a "network of networks" because it is literally made up of thousands of local networks that are connected to each other.**
