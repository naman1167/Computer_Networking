## Other Wireless Networks

### **Global Positioning System (GPS) üõ∞Ô∏è**

The GPS uses satellites to transmit signals that cover the globe. The smartphone can receive these signals and calculate the phone‚Äôs location to an accuracy of within 10 meters.

### **Wi-Fi üì∂**

Wi-Fi transmitters and receivers located within the smartphone enable the phone to connect to local networks and the internet. **In order to receive and send data on a Wi-Fi network, the phone needs to be within the range of the signal from a wireless network access point.** Wi-Fi networks are usually privately owned but often provide guest or public access hotspots. A hotspot is an area where Wi-Fi signals are available. Wi-Fi network connections on the phone are similar to the network connections on a laptop computer.

### **NFC üì±üí≥**

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a wireless communication technology that enables data to be exchanged by devices that are in very close proximity to each other, usually less than a few centimeters. For example, NFC can be used to connect a smartphone and a payment system. NFC uses electromagnetic fields to transmit data.
