# 📶 **Configure Mobile Wi-Fi Connectivity**

If your mobile device does not prompt to connect to a Wi-Fi network, **the network SSID broadcast may be turned off, or the device may not be set to connect automatically.** Manually configure the Wi-Fi settings on the mobile device. 

⚠️ **Remember:** SSIDs and passphrases must be typed **exactly** as entered on the wireless router setup, or the device will not connect properly, as shown in the figure.

- **SSID** 🏷️ - The name assigned to a wireless network.
- **Passphrase** 🔑 - The "wireless password" required for authentication.
