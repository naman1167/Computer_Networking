# Network Components

## Network Infrastructure

The network infrastructure consists of three categories of hardware components:

- **End devices**
- **Intermediate devices**
- **Network media**

Some network components, such as wireless media, may not be visible. Wireless networks use radio frequencies or infrared waves to transmit data through the air.

## End Devices

End devices, also known as hosts, are the network components that users interact with. They serve as the interface between users and the communication network.

### Examples of End Devices:
- Computers (workstations, laptops, file servers, web servers)
- Network printers
- Telephones and teleconferencing equipment
- Security cameras
- Mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, PDAs, wireless debit/credit card readers, barcode scanners)

An end device functions as either the source or destination of a message transmitted over the network. Each host is uniquely identified by an address, which is used to determine the destination when communication is initiated.
