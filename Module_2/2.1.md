# **Clients and Servers**

## **Clients, Servers, and Their Role**

All computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts. Hosts can send and receive messages on the network. In modern networks, computer hosts can act as a client, a server, or both. The software installed on the computer determines which role the computer plays.

## **Peer-to-Peer Networks**

Client and server software usually run on separate computers, but it is also possible for one computer to run both client and server software at the same time. In small businesses and homes, many computers function as both servers and clients on the network. This type of network is called a **peer-to-peer (P2P) network**.

Multiple PCs can also be connected to create a larger P2P network, but this **requires a network device, such as a switch, to interconnect the computers.**

### **Advantages of Peer-to-Peer Networking:**
- Easy to set up
- Less complex
- Lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required
- Can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers

### **Disadvantages of Peer-to-Peer Networking:**
- No centralized administration
- Not as secure
- Not scalable
- All devices may act as both clients and servers, which can slow their performance

## **Peer-to-Peer Applications**

A P2P application allows a device to act as both a client and a server within the same communication. In this model, every client is a server, and every server is a client. P2P applications require that each end device provide a user interface and run a background service.

Some P2P applications use a hybrid system where resource sharing is decentralized, but the indexes that point to resource locations are stored in a centralized directory. In a hybrid system, each peer accesses an index server to get the location of a resource stored on another peer.

## **Multiple Roles in the Network**

A computer with server software can provide services simultaneously to one or many clients. Additionally, a single computer can run multiple types of server software. In a home or small business, it may be necessary for one computer to act as a file server, a web server, and an email server.

A single computer can also run multiple types of client software. There must be client software for every service required. With multiple clients installed, a host can connect to multiple servers at the same time. For example, a user can check email and view a web page while instant messaging and listening to internet radio.
