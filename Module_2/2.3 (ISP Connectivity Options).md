## **ISP services üåç**

An ISP can be the local cable provider, a landline telephone service provider, the cellular network that provides your smartphone service, or an independent provider who leases bandwidth on the physical network infrastructure of another company.

**Each ISP connects to other ISPs to form a network of links that interconnect users all over the world. ISPs are connected in a hierarchical manner that ensures that internet traffic generally takes the shortest path from the source to the destination.**

## **ISP Connections üîó**

The interconnection of ISPs that forms the backbone of the internet is a complex web of fiber-optic cables with expensive networking switches and routers **that direct the flow of information between source and destination hosts.**

As shown in the bottom portion of the figure, **a router is required to securely connect a computer to an ISP. This is the most common connection option**. It consists of using a wireless integrated router to connect to the ISP. The router includes a switch to connect wired hosts and a wireless AP to connect wireless hosts. The router also provides client IP addressing information and security for inside hosts.

The figure shows two groups of end devices connect to a cloud depicting ISP through separate modems. From left to right, at the top, a PC with the label Single PC with Direct Connection connects to a modem through a cable and the modem connects to the cloud. At the bottom, three PCs with the label Multiple PCs with LAN connection connect to a wireless router labeled Integrated Router. The router connects to another modem and the modem connects to the cloud.

## **Cable and DSL Connections üì°**

- **Cable -** ‚ö° Typically offered by cable television service providers, the internet data signal is carried on the same coaxial cable that delivers cable television. It provides a high bandwidth, always on, connection to the internet. A special cable modem separates the internet data signal from the other signals carried on the cable and provides an Ethernet connection to a host computer or LAN.
- **DSL - Digital Subscriber Line** üìû provides a high bandwidth, always on, connection to the internet. It requires a special high-speed modem that separates the DSL signal from the telephone signal and provides an Ethernet connection to a host computer or LAN. **DSL runs over a telephone line, with the line split into three channels.** One channel is used for voice telephone calls. This channel allows an individual to receive phone calls without disconnecting from the internet. A second channel is a faster download channel, used to receive information from the internet. The third channel is used for sending or uploading information. This channel is usually slightly slower than the download channel. The quality and speed of the DSL connection depends mainly on the quality of the phone line and the distance from the central office of your phone company. The farther you are from the central office, the slower the connection.
