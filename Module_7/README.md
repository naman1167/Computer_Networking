# MODULE 7: Encapsulation 🛡️📦

## Overview 📖

In this module, we will cover **Encapsulation**, a fundamental concept in networking. Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data with the necessary protocol information before transmission over a network. It ensures that data is properly formatted, addressed, transmitted, and received. 🔄📡

## Key Topics 📌

- 🔹 **What is Encapsulation?**
- 🔹 **The Role of Encapsulation in Networking**
- 🔹 **The Encapsulation Process in the OSI Model**
- 🔹 **De-Encapsulation: How Data is Received and Processed**
- 🔹 **Importance of Encapsulation in Secure Communication 🔐**

## Learning Objectives 🎯

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

✅ Understand the concept and purpose of encapsulation in networking.  
✅ Identify different layers of encapsulation in the OSI model.  
✅ Explain how data is encapsulated and de-encapsulated during transmission.  
✅ Recognize the significance of encapsulation in secure data communication.  

## Prerequisites 📚

Before starting this module, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of:

🔹 Networking fundamentals 🌐  
🔹 The OSI model and its layers 📶  
🔹 Network protocols such as TCP/IP 🖧  

## Resources 📂

Additional resources will be provided throughout the module, including diagrams, examples, and hands-on exercises. 📝🔍
