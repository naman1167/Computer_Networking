## **OSI Model and TCP/IP Model Comparison**

- The TCP/IP protocol suite does not specify which protocols to use when transmitting over a physical medium, nor the method of encoding the signals for transmission. OSI Layers 1 and 2 discuss the necessary procedures to access the media and the physical means to send data over a network.
- The functions that occur at the internet layer in the TCP/IP model are contained in the network layer of the OSI Model, as shown in the figure. The transport layer functionality is the same between both models.

The key similarities are in the transport and network layers; however, the two models differ in how they relate to the layers above and below each layer:

- **OSI Layer 3**, the network layer, maps directly to the **TCP/IP internet layer**. This layer is used to describe protocols that address and route messages through an internetwork.
- **OSI Layer 4**, the transport layer, maps directly to the **TCP/IP transport layer**. This layer describes general services and functions that provide ordered and reliable delivery of data between source and destination hosts.
- The **TCP/IP application layer** includes several protocols that provide specific functionality to a variety of end-user applications. The **OSI model Layers 5, 6, and 7** are used as references for application software developers and vendors to produce applications that operate on networks.
- Both the **TCP/IP and OSI models** are commonly used when referring to protocols at various layers. Because the OSI model separates the **data link layer from the physical layer**, it is commonly used when referring to these lower layers.
