## 🌐 **The Internet and Standards**

Networking and internet standards ensure that all devices connecting to the network implement the same set of rules or protocols in the same manner. ✅ This makes it possible for different types of devices to send information to each other over the internet. 📡

## 🏛️ **Network Standards Organizations**

When a new standard is proposed, each stage of the development and approval process is recorded in a numbered Request for Comments (RFC) document 📜 so that the evolution of the standard is tracked. 🔄 RFCs for internet standards are published and managed by the **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)**. 🌍
