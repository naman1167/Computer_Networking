These rules, or protocols, must be followed in order for the message to be successfully delivered and understood. Among the protocols that govern successful human communication are these:

- 📞 **Agreed upon method of communicating** (face-to-face, telephone, letter, photograph)  
- 📝 **Common language and grammar**  
- ⏳ **Speed and timing of delivery**  
- 🔔 **Confirmation or acknowledgment requirements**
